# ADQ-Automation

Overview
The MPQ Automation Script is a sophisticated Python-driven solution designed to streamline the calculation of Minimum Product Quantities (MPQs) and automate the generation of MPQ/ADQ files for retail merchandising. By leveraging Teradata database integration, advanced data analysis, and quantile-based refinement, this script ensures optimal product placement in store fixtures while eliminating manual errors and inefficiencies.

Key Capabilities
- Automated MPQ Calculation: Dynamically determines the ideal product quantities per fixture based on volume constraints, product dimensions, and case pack requirements.
- Database Integration: Connects directly to Teradata, retrieving real-time product, fixture, and sales data for precise decision-making.
- Data Accuracy & Refinement: Identifies outliers through IQR-based analysis, ensuring data integrity and consistency.
- Dynamic File Generation: Seamlessly compiles all computations into a structured MPQ/ADQ Excel file, reducing manual effort and formatting errors.
- Scalability & Standardization: Enables uniform product displays across multiple retail locations, supporting data-driven merchandising strategies.

Business Impact
This automation script enhances efficiency, accuracy, and standardization in retail planning, empowering merchandising teams to make informed, data-backed decisions. By replacing manual calculations with intelligent automation, it significantly improves operational workflow, ensuring that products are displayed in the most optimized and strategic mannerâ€”ultimately driving higher sales and customer satisfaction.
